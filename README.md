## Open Roles

- **[Contract Writer (Cloud Native)](/contract-writer-cn.md) ($2000 per month)** - If you specialize in Kubernetes and you want steady writing work to showcase your expertise while being paid competitively, this role is for you.
- **[Freelance Technical Writer](https://draft.dev/#write) ($300-$500 per blog post)** - If you're a software developer and you want to build your personal brand while getting paid to write about interesting technical topics, you've come to the right place. Unlike our Contract Writers, you can contribute as much or as little as you want - no monthly minimums.
