## About the Company
[Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/) is a content marketing agency focused on creating in-depth, technical content for growing technology startups. We work with subject matter experts from around the world to create tutorials, blog posts, and e-books for our clients. Founded in 2020, [we're a small, but focused team](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1337141695432024065) of technologists, writers, marketers, editors, and designers.

**And now we're looking for someone to join as a part-time content planner.**

-----

### We'd Like Someone Who Can:
- Understand complex technical topics at a high level (must have prior software engineering, product management, or team leadership experience)
- Perform detailed research
- Learn new topics at a high-level very quickly
- Condense and organize information into an easily digestible outline
- Consistently deliver high-quality work on deadline with a positive attitude and learning mindset

### What You'll Do
You'll be in charge of turning a rough idea for an article into a detailed content brief ([here's an example](https://draft.dev/learn/posts/content-plan)). Our writers will then use that brief to compose articles for our clients.

Sometimes you'll have to use your Googling skills to find similar articles for use as a template. Other times, you'll need to read the documentation and learn how a new tool works. Once you understand the topic, you'll create a detailed outline and description for the article and then make revisions as requested by the client.

### Expectations:
- Create 10+ briefs per week (depending on your availability)
- 2-day turnarounds on revisions
- Prompt, professional communication via email

### Perks:
- 100% flexible hours, location, and asynchronous work
- Regular feedback from our team and clients
- Help shape the direction of a quickly growing small business
