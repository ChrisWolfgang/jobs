## About the Company
[Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/) is a content marketing agency focused on creating in-depth, technical content for growing technology startups. We work with subject matter experts from around the world to create tutorials, blog posts, and e-books for our clients. Founded in 2020, [we're a small but focused team](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1337141695432024065) of technologists, writers, marketers, editors, and designers.

**And now we're looking for someone to join as a part-time technical reviewer.**

-----

### We'd Like Someone Who Can:
- Understand a wide range of software programming topics at a moderate to deep level (must have prior software engineering experience)
- Perform quick research to supplement personal knowledge
- Learn new topics at a high level very quickly
- Professionally and politely communicate areas for improvement to technical writers
- Hit deadlines and communicate with the Draft.dev team as necessary

### What You'll Do
You'll review articles written by software developers and other technical professionals for technical accuracy. You will leave professional and clear comments in the article's Google Doc with any technical revisions the writer needs to address.

Sometimes this will mean following along with a tutorial and making sure steps are clear and complete, noticing when tools are obviously used or necessary but not mentioned, making sure that any demo apps work.
You may need to read the documentation and learn how a new tool works. Rarely, you may be asked if you are able to complete a revision if for some reason the original writer is not able to.

### Expectations:
- Review 10+ technical articles per week (depending on your availability)
- Offer prompt, professional, relevant communication via email and comments in Google Docs

### Perks:
- 100% flexible hours, location, and asynchronous work
- Regular feedback from our team and clients
- Work directly with [Draft.dev's content lead](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ksiig/)
- Help shape the direction of a quickly growing small business
