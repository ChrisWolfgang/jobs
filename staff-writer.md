## About the Company
[Draft.dev](https://draft.dev/) is a content marketing agency focused on creating in-depth, technical content for growing technology startups. We work with subject matter experts from around the world to create tutorials, blog posts, and e-books for our clients. Founded in 2020, [we're a small, but focused team](https://twitter.com/KarlLHughes/status/1337141695432024065) of technologists, writers, marketers, editors, and designers.

**And now we're looking for someone to join as our first staff writer.**

### We'd Like Someone Who Can:
- Understand complex technical topics at a high level 
- Perform detailed research
- Find and interview sources (technology team leaders, software engineers, and data scientists)
- Write with a genuine, persuasive, and authoritative style
- Consistently deliver high-quality written work on deadline with a positive attitude and learning mindset

### The Kind of Content You'll Write
Here are some examples of the types of articles you'll be responsible for writing each month. While you probably won't know everything about these topics, you'll be responsible for researching each topic and finding suitable sources to help you create authoritative content surrounding software development and leadership:

- [The Case for Codeless Testing](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/case-for-codeless-testing)
- [Bring Your Own Cloud: Introduction to Bitmovin Cloud Connect Encoding](https://bitmovin.com/introducing-cloud-connect-encoding-aws-gcp-azure/)

- [What the "No-Code" Movement Means for Software Developers](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/what-no-code-movement-means-for-software-developers)

You may also have to work with developers or source code samples occasionally. You don't have to be an expert coder, but you should be able to scan a piece of code and get some idea about what's going on.

### Expectations:
- 6-10 ~1500-word articles per month (depending on your availablity)
- Consistent 1-2 day turnarounds on edits (usually 1-2 rounds per article)
- Weekly editorial planning meeting for each month's assignments
